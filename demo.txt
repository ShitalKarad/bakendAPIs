//dotenv
DotEnv is a lightweight npm package that automatically loads environment variables from a .
 env file into the process. env object.

 //What Is Express JS?     
Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile 
applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application.

It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.

Why Express JS?
Express was created to make APIs and web applications with ease,
It saves a lot of coding time almost by half and still makes web and 
mobile applications are efficient.
Another reason for using express is that it is written in javascript as javascript is an easy language
 even if you don't have a previous
knowledge of any language. Express lets so many new developers enter the field of web development.
The reason behind creating an express framework for node js is:

Time-efficient
Fast 
Economical
Easy to learn
Asynchronous

//Features of Express JS
Fast Server-Side Development 
The features of node js help express saving a lot of time.

Middleware
Middleware is a request handler that has access to the application's request-response cycle.

Routing 
It refers to how an application's endpoint's URLs respond to client requests.

Templating 
It provides templating engines to build dynamic content on the web pages by creating HTML templates on the server

//exp-api-cli
 Express api cli allows you to create a new project within minutes with little or no configuration. You create
  your project and you start developing your business logic right away.

  // controller 
  accept the request from routes and pass it to service

  //mogoose
  Mongoose is a MongoDB ODM i.e (Object database Modelling) library that used to translate the code and its 
  representation from MongoDB to the Node. js server. Advantages of Mongoose module: Collection 
  validation of the MongoDB database can be done easily.

  mogoose is a object database module(odm) library it allows u to communicate your bakend to database
  it allows u to declre scemas and its vali dation.

  Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB. It defines a strongly-typed-schema, 
  with default values and schema validations which are later mapped to a MongoDB document. 

//what is odm(objecct database modeling)
  Mongoose, on the other hand, is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that provides a higher-level
   abstraction layer on top of MongoDB. It allows developers to define their data models using a schema-based 
   approach and provides a rich set of features that simplify the process of working with MongoDB.

  //logger
  Logger handles all logs in the application
  The Logger class provides logging functionality for an application. It can be used to display errors,
   warnings and debug messages.

//middlewares

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object ( req ), the response object ( res ), 
and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. The next middleware 
function is commonly denoted by a variable named next .

Middleware to authenticate if user has a valid Authorization token
 * Authorization: Bearer <token>
 *
 * @param {Object} req
 * @param {Object} res
 * @param {Function} next

 //cors

 CORS or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in Node.js is a mechanism by which a front-end client
  can make requests for resources to an external back-end server. The single-origin policy does 
 not allow cross-origin requests and CORS headers are required to bypass this feature

 //helmet
 What is Helmet? Helmet. js is an open source JavaScript library that helps you secure your Node. 
 js application by setting several HTTP headers.

 //Routing:
Express makes it easy to define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL patterns.
 You can handle requests to specific routes with corresponding callback functions.

Middleware:
Middleware functions are functions that execute between the incoming request and the final route handler. 
They can perform tasks like logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, and more. Express 
allows you to define and use middleware to customize the request-response flow.

//param
params property is an object that contains the properties which are mapped to the named route "parameters".
 For example, if you have a route as /api/:name, then the "name" property is available as req.params.name.
  The default value of this object is {}.

  //Generic error response middleware for internal server errors.
  //Error response middleware for handling all app errors except generic errors.

  //API Call:
From your frontend or any API client (e.g., Postman), send a POST request to your API endpoint /api/users with
 the user data in the request body. This data will be handled by the controller and saved in the MongoDB database.

Remember to adapt this structure to your specific project's needs, and make sure to handle error cases and potential 
security concerns, such as data validation and sanitization.
